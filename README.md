<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/images/screenshot.jpg)

Checkout the live demo on [Netlify](https://vigilant-bell-9f7436.netlify.app/).

This time Encore helped me to organizing files but I lost lot of time on a problem I already met: script not loading because I forgot to include `runtime.js` and vendors script manually. 

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Little bit of Vanilla Js

### Run in local

```shell
yarn install

# launch Encore's dev server
yarn dev-server

# load the project in local server
yarn start

# both last previous commands should be executed in two different terminal
```
